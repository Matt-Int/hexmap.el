#+title: hexmap.el

An emacs package for drawing hex maps using a text file to specify each tile.

Uses axial coordinates to avoid running into corners while mapping out a world. Each hex is specified with a combination of axial coordinates (x,y) followed by a block of specifiers, e.g. biome, terrain, features, and roads. The latter two are lists as each hex can support multiple ones.
